# airbnb-clone-project

# A brief description of this project 

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, 
real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb.
It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, 
focusing on backend systems, database design, 
API development, and application security.

# Project goals
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Technology Stack  

This project uses a modern technology stack to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability.  

### Backend  
- **Django** – A Python web framework for building robust backend APIs and handling business logic.  
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** – Extends Django to create RESTful APIs with serialization and authentication support.  
- **GraphQL (Graphene-Django)** – Provides a flexible query language for fetching only the required data.  

### Database  
- **PostgreSQL** – A reliable relational database for storing structured data such as users, properties, bookings, and payments.  

### Frontend  
- **React.js** – A JavaScript library for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.  
- **Tailwind CSS** – A utility-first CSS framework for styling the frontend quickly and responsively.  

### DevOps & Deployment  
- **Docker** – Containerizes the application for consistent environments across development and production.  
- **GitHub Actions** – Automates CI/CD pipelines for testing, building, and deployment.  
- **Heroku / AWS / GCP / Azure** – Cloud platforms for hosting and scaling the application.  

### Security & Authentication  
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** – Secures user authentication between client and server.  
- **HTTPS/TLS** – Encrypts communication to protect sensitive user and payment data.  

# Team Roles
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Database Design  

The database is designed to manage users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments. Each entity stores critical information and maintains relationships with other entities to ensure data consistency.  

### Entities & Fields  

#### 1. Users  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `name`  
- `email`  
- `password_hash`  
- `role` (guest, host, admin)  

#### 2. Properties  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
- `title`  
- `description`  
- `location`  
- `price_per_night`  

#### 3. Bookings  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)  
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
- `check_in_date`  
- `check_out_date`  
- `status` (pending, confirmed, cancelled)  

#### 4. Reviews  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)  
- `rating` (1–5)  
- `comment`  

#### 5. Payments  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Bookings)  
- `amount`  
- `payment_date`  
- `status` (paid, refunded, pending)  

### Entity Relationships  
- **User → Properties**: One-to-Many (a host can list many properties).  
- **User → Bookings**: One-to-Many (a guest can make multiple bookings).  
- **Property → Bookings**: One-to-Many (a property can be booked many times).  
- **User → Reviews**: One-to-Many (a user can write multiple reviews).  
- **Property → Reviews**: One-to-Many (a property can have multiple reviews).  
- **Booking → Payment**: One-to-One (each booking has one payment).  


# Feature Breakdown
Feature Breakdown

This project replicates the core functionality of an Airbnb project. Below are the main features and their purpose within the system:

1. User Management

Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Roles include guests (who book properties) and hosts (who list properties). This ensures secure access and personalized experiences.

2. Property Management

Hosts can list properties by adding details such as title, description, location, price, and availability. This feature allows potential guests to browse and choose suitable accommodation.

3. Booking System

Guests can book available properties by selecting check-in and check-out dates. The system prevents double bookings and tracks the status of each booking (pending, confirmed, or cancelled).

4. Review System

After completing a stay, guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties. This builds trust and helps other users make informed decisions when choosing a property.

5. Payment Processing

Each booking is linked to a payment record, allowing guests to pay securely for their stay. Payments include details such as amount, date, and status, ensuring transparency between guests and hosts.
# API Security
API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect sensitive user data, ensure trust, and maintain the integrity of the platform. The following measures will be implemented:

1. Authentication

APIs will require secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT-based authentication) to verify user identity before granting access. This prevents unauthorized users from accessing private endpoints and ensures only registered users can interact with the system.

2. Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) will be applied to ensure users only perform actions they are permitted to (e.g., guests cannot modify other hosts’ properties). This prevents privilege escalation and misuse of system resources.

3. Data Encryption

Sensitive information such as passwords and payment details will be encrypted (both in transit using HTTPS/TLS and at rest). This safeguards user data from interception or unauthorized access.

4. Rate Limiting & Throttling

API endpoints will enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or brute-force login attempts. This ensures system availability and fair usage for all users.

5. Input Validation & Sanitization

All incoming requests will be validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS (cross-site scripting), and command injection. This strengthens backend reliability and data integrity.

6. Secure Payments Handling

Payment-related APIs will integrate with trusted third-party providers and follow PCI-DSS standards. This ensures financial transactions are processed safely, protecting both guests and hosts from fraud.

# CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application. They ensure that new changes are integrated smoothly, tested automatically, and deployed consistently without manual intervention.

Implementing CI/CD is important for this project because it improves development speed, reduces errors, and ensures that new features or fixes reach users quickly and reliably.

Tools & Technologies

GitHub Actions – Automates testing, linting, and deployment workflows directly from the repository.

Docker – Ensures consistent application environments across development, testing, and production.

Docker Compose / Kubernetes – Can be used for orchestrating multi-service deployments.

Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, or Heroku) – Host and scale the application with integrated CI/CD support.
